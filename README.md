# BlueBridge
BlueBridge is a modular bridge plugin for Bukkit (or Spigot/Paper) servers with the aim to bring multiple minecraft region plugins to BlueMap (Currently, only WorldGuard is supported but more addons are on their way).

# How to use
Install BlueBridgeCore and the addons you need just like any other plugin, configure them to fit your needs and you are ready to go!

# Download
Take a look at the [realeses](https://github.com/Mark-225/BlueBridge/releases) section for direct downloads of the plugin jar files or build the plugin yourself by cloning this repo and executing "gradlew build" from the main directory.
